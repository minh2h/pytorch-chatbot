who determines
the fact that a monster like trump has so much support in america helps explain why i want my daughter to grow up in canada .
that's not hyperbole, nor support for any other candidate, it's fact. a country where so many love that man is not good enough for my girl.
where is the boss in here ?
i'm in the bear suit, or maybe was on an airplane :)
that s pretty nice .
it makes up for the shitty parts of working for this school thats for sure.
but all the rest decided that woman is devil because in other case it is necessary to put mother on the first place .
but if to put mother/god'smother on the 1st place, then men will start to loose their primary spot, &amp;no man can let that happen.
well that sounds promising ! d
well it underscores the importance of having a plan - you know what a plan is right rocket?
