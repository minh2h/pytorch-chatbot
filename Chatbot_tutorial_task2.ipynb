    "In this tutorial, we explore a fun and interesting use-case of recurrent sequence-to-sequence models. We will train a simple chatbot using movie scripts from the [Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html). \n",

    "Conversational models are a hot topic in artificial intelligence research. Chatbots can be found in a variety of settings, including customer service applications and online helpdesks. These bots are often powered by retrieval-based models, which output predefined responses to questions of certain forms. In a highly restricted domain like a company's IT helpdesk, these models may be sufficient, however, they are not robust enough for more general use-cases. Teaching a machine to carry out a meaningful conversation with a human in multiple domains is a research question that is far from solved. Recently, the deep learning boom has allowed for powerful generative models like Google's [Neural Conversational Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05869), which marks a large step towards multi-domain generative conversational models. In this tutorial, we will implement this kind of model in PyTorch.\n",

    "## Prepare Data for Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we have spent a great effort preparing and massaging our data into a nice vocabulary object and list of sentence pairs, our models will ultimately expect numerical torch tensors as inputs. One way to prepare the processed data for the models can be found in the [seq2seq translation tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/seq2seq_translation_tutorial.html). In that tutorial, we use a batch size of 1, meaning that all we have to do is convert the words in our sentence pairs to their corresponding indexes from the vocabulary and feed this to the models. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you're interested in speeding up training and/or would like to leverage GPU parallelization capabilities, you will need to train with mini-batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using minibatches also means that we must be mindful of the variation of sentence length in our batches. To accomodate sentences of different sizes in the same batch, we will make our batched input tensor of shape *(max_length, batch_size)*, where sentences shorter than the *max_length* are zero padded after an *EOS_token*.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we simply convert our English sentences to tensors by converting words to their indexes(`indexesFromSentence`) and zero-pad, our tensor would have shape *(batch_size, max_length)* and indexing the first dimension would return a full sequence across all time-steps. However, we need to be able to index our batch along time, and across all sequences in the batch. Therefore, we transpose our input batch shape to *(max_length, batch_size)*, so that indexing across the first dimension returns a time step across all sentences in the batch. We handle this transpose implicitly in the `zeroPadding` function. \n",
    "\n",
    "![batches](images/seq2seq_batches.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `inputVar` function handles the process of converting sentences to tensor, ultimately creating a correctly shaped zero-padded tensor. It also returns a tensor of lengths for each of the sequences in the batch which will be passed to our decoder later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `outputVar` function performs a similar function to `inputVar`, but instead of returning a `lengths` tensor, it returns binary mask tensor and a maximum target sentence length. The binary mask tensor has the same shape as the output target tensor, but every element that is a *PAD_token* is 0 and all others are 1.\n",

In theory, this context vector (the final hidden layer of the RNN) will contain semantic information about the query sentence that is input to the bot. The second RNN is a **decoder**, which takes an input word and the context vector, and returns a guess for the next word in the sequence and a hidden state to use in the next iteration.\n",

    "Recall that the decoder is responsible for predicting an output sentence, word by word, using the hidden state of the encoder and the previous word. A common problem, however, is that if we rely soley on the context vector to encode the entire input sentence's meaning, it is likely that we will have information loss. This is especially the case when dealing with long input sequences, greatly limiting the capability of our decoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "To combat this, [Bahdanau et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473) created an \"attention mechanism\" that allows the decoder to pay attention to certain parts of the input sequence, rather than relying on a fixed context.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, attention is calculated using the decoder's current hidden state and the encoder's outputs. The output attention weights have the same shape as the input sequence, allowing us to multiply them by the encoder outputs, giving us a weighted sum which indicates what parts of encoder output to pay attention to.

    "[Luong et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04025) improved upon Bahdanau et al.'s groundwork by creating \"Global attention\". The key difference is that with \"Global attention\", we consider all of the encoder's hidden states, as opposed to Bahdanau et al.'s \"Local attention\", which only considers the encoder's hidden state from the current time step. Another difference is that with \"Global attention\", we calculate attention weights, or energies, using the hidden state of the decoder from the current time step only. Bahdanau et al.'s attention calculation requires knowledge of the decoder's state from the previous time step. Also, Luong et al. provides various methods to calculate the attention energies between the encoder output and decoder output which are called \"score functions\":\n",

This technique acts as training wheels for the decoder, aiding in more efficient training. However, teacher forcing can lead to model instability during inference, as the decoder may not have a sufficient chance to truly craft its own output sequences during training. Thus, we must be mindful of how we are setting the `teacher_forcing_ratio`, and not be fooled by fast convergence.\n",

Alternatively, you ran run these modules one time step (word) at a time. In this case, we manually loop over the sequences during the training process like we must do for the `decoder` model.

    "Now that we have our decoding method defined, we can write functions for evaluating a string input sentence. The `evaluate` function manages the low-level process of handling the input sentence. We first format the sentence as an input batch of word indexes with *batch_size==1*. We do this by converting the words of the sentence to their corresponding indexes, and transposing the dimensions to prepare the tensor for our models. Concurrently, we create our `lengths` tensor which contains the length of our input sentence. In this case, `lengths` is scalar because we are only evaluating one sentence at a time (batch_size==1). Next, we obtain the decoded response sentence tensor using our `GreedySearchDecoder` object (`searcher`). Finally, we convert the response's indexes to words and return the list of decoded words.\n",

    "`evaluateInput` acts as the user interface for our chatbot. When called, an input text field will spawn in which we can enter our query sentence. After typing our input sentence and pressing *Enter*, our text is normalized in the same way as our training data, and is ultimately fed to the `evaluate` function to obtain a decoded output sentence. We loop this process, so we can keep chatting with our bot until we enter either \"q\" or \"quit\".\n",
